# Learn-Lessons-CleanUp

The objective for this project is to create a master repo that links to all the lessons in the curriculum.

`git` has its own idea of nested file structure. It uses _**submodules**_ to reference different repos. The following code automates the process of adding all the lessons you have done to a single `github` repo.
